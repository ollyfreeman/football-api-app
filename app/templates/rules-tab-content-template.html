  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>This game is designed to prototype a new gambling application that takes inspiration from
  classic British football 'Pools' betting. The final product would use live updates from
  <a ng-href='{{rulesTabCtrl.footballApiURL}}' target='_blank'>football-api.com</a>.
  However, to make designing, testing and demonstrationg viable, it currently uses an API that was
  built to mock on-demand the live feed that would be received from
  <a href='{{rulesTabCtrl.footballApiURL}}' target='_blank'>football-api.com</a> (see the API tab).
  This API has the option of simulating the matches at a higher rate - this game uses that functionality,
  so the games are simulated at x60 speed (i.e. 1 simulated minute lasts 1 second).</p>

  <h3>How to play</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Predict the outcome of each of the matches: to predict that either of the teams will win,
    you click on that teams name - to predict that the match will end in a draw, which is the default
    selection, you click the 'v' symbol.</li>
    <li>Click START.</li>
    <li>As the simulation proceeds, you can change your predictions. It is only your most recent prediction for
    each match that counts towards your score - but note that the later in this prediction happened, the fewer
    points you receive if your prediction is correct. The graph displays your current score, which will change as
    goals as scored and as you change you predictions. </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Match data</h3>
  <p>The simulated match data is from the Premier League matches played on the final day of the 2014-2015
  season, on Sunday 24th May 2015.</p>
